# Knaus purity test!

A purity test for Samfundet! It also includes statistics from other people.

The page is deployed to Github pages at https://hakonw.github.io/knaus-purity-test/

The backend is deployed over at Google Cloud Functions.

## Why

Why not. I like to read statistics.

## Improvements

- [x] Working page
- [x] Basic stats
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Better structure
- [ ] Enviroment variables
- [ ] Automatic CD
- [ ] Reworked backend
- [ ] Cache

## Note

The application uses cookies to save a unique id and the previous state.

No identifiable personal data is collected.

### The code

IT has no test and is in a messy state.

It is a future me problem to fix it (heh).
